0,morningman,0.15.0-rc04,2021-12-28 10:41:56,CONTRIBUTOR AUTHOR,"The following is the 【Roadmap】 for the Doris community in 2022.The plan includes all aspects of code 【feature】s, documentation, community building, etc. that are to be developed, have already been developed, and have been completed but require ongoing optimization. The plan is currently under discussion, so if you have comments or suggestions on any aspect of the plan or beyond, please feel free to leave a comment or send an email to dev@doris.apache.org. We will gradually create issues or jira for each direction of the plan to describe and track the progress in detail. Developers who wish to contribute are also welcome to create issues directly and associate with them (just leave a comment) The directions marked (Good First Issue) in the plan are more independent modules, which are more suitable for newbie tasks or developers who are new to Doris. If you are interested in the relevant direction, please contact us at dev@doris.apache.org or under this issue, and we will provide detailed guidance, help and discussion. The directions marked with (Q1) are the current work to be completed in the first quarter of 2022. We will update the schedule and progress of other directions gradually. The marked (Done & Optimizing) directions are the directions that are currently completed but need continuous optimization. Such as ease of use, 【feature】 additions, and documentation additions. We encourage developers to discuss anything in the dev mailing list, to subscribe to the mailing list please refer to [How to subscribe](http://doris.incubator.apache.org/master/en/community/subscribemaillist.html). 【Feature】s     [ ] 7571      [ ] Extensible new query optimizer framework     [ ] 6370     [ ] Standard 【test】 set 【support】 and performance enhancements            + TPCDS 【feature】 pass rate 100%            + TPCH performance enhancements     [ ] 7572     [ ] Pipeline execution engine     [ ] Algorithm Concurrency Control and Resource Control     [ ] 7573     [x] 7570     [ ] Map     [ ] Struct [x] 7574    Provides Schemaless semantics for fast analysis of semistructured data.
